    "# Practical exercise: Iterative calculus with some interesting functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following steps as best you are able:\n",
    "  1. Write some functions to calculate higher-order derivatives, using lower-order derivatives as the building blocks.\n",
    "  2. Write some functions to calculate higher-order integrals, using lower-order integrals as the building blocks.\n",
    "  3. Confirm whether the $\\sin$ function is really its own fourth derivative, using what built both for (1) and for (2).\n",
    "  4. Confirm whether the exponential function really is its own derivative, using what you built for both (1) and (2).\n",
    "  5. Observe how the patter of errors varies, and induce catastrophic numerical errors if possible, for either (3) or (4), using one or some combination of the following methods:\n",
    "      1. Taking a very high-order derivative.\n",
    "      2. Taking a very high-order integral.\n",
    "      3. Taking some derivatives, and then integrating by the same order, back and forth, perhaps a large number of times.\n",
    "    \n",
    "*Bonus:* Complete some of the steps above with a third, different function that you think has derivatives/integrals with interesting properties."
