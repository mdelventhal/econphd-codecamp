    "\n",
    "Numerically \"prove\" L'Hopital's rule. Use at least some aspects of Object-Oriented Programming to construct your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use any approach you like. Here are some ideas which might help you formulate a viable approach:\n",
    "  - It might be more interesting to do this proof for zero-divide-by-zero \"holes\" rather than infinity-divide-by-infinity asymptotes. But if you have an idea for asymptotes feel free to go for it!\n",
    "  - A proof might consist of a visualization demonstrating the behavior to proven, and/or text output demonstrating the behavior to be proven at closer and closer points to the limit.\n",
    "  - Numerical differentiation could be useful for calculating the first derivatives. It could especially help you make your solution more general, so that it could work for any combination of numerator/denominator.\n",
    "  - Some things that might be \"attributes\" of your object:\n",
    "      + the numerator function\n",
    "      + the denominator function\n",
    "  - Some things that might be \"methods\" of your object:\n",
    "      + operations related to creating the visual or text-based demonstration\n",
